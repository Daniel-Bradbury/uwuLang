# uwuLang
#### This programming language requires Python 3 to operate
#### It also needs to run in a Linux environnmet, although you can still run it on Windows using the Linux Subsystem.

</br>

## Usage
bash uwulang.sh [inupt file]

## Syntax (and Brainfuck equivilants)
#### All instructions must be seperated by spaces

`uwu` (+)

`owo` (-)

`>w>` (>)

`<w<` (<)

`uou` (.)

`>w<` (,)

`(CHAR)` (Prints the character in the parentheses)


## Character outputing
uwuLang has an added feature over Brainfuck, that being the ability to output individual characters without having to do math with ascii tables and whatnot.

To do this just simply put a single character in brackets, like so:
`(a)`

You can output a string of characters by putting multiple character in brackets next to eachother:
`(u)(w)(u)`
